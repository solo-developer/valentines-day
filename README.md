# Valentine's Day Website for Denisha ❤️

This is a special interactive website dedicated to Denisha.

## How to Customize
1. **Photos**: 
   - I have used placeholder images (generated cats/colors).
   - Gather your best photos of you and Denisha.
   - Save them in this folder (e.g., `pic1.jpg`, `pic2.jpg`).
   - Open `index.html` in a text editor (like Notepad or VS Code).
   - Find the lines that say `src="https://placehold.co/..."`.
   - Change them to your file names, e.g., `src="pic1.jpg"`.

2. **Text**:
   - You can change "My Life Changed..." or any other text in `index.html` to be more personal.

## How to Preview
1. Simply double-click `index.html` to open it in your browser.
2. Test the "No" button escaping logic!

## How to Publish to Vercel
Since you might not have Node.js installed (based on previous errors), the easiest way is via **GitHub**:

1. **Create a GitHub Account** (if you don't have one) at [github.com](https://github.com).
2. **Create a New Repository** named `vday-gift`.
3. **Upload Files**:
   - Click "Upload an existing file" in your new repository.
   - Drag `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` (and your photos) into the browser window.
   - Click "Commit changes".
4. **Go to Vercel**:
   - Log in to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com).
   - Click **"Add New..."** -> **"Project"**.
   - Select "Continue with GitHub" and choose the `vday-gift` repository you just made.
   - Click **"Deploy"**.
5. **Done!** Vercel will give you a link (e.g., `vday-gift.vercel.app`) to share with Denisha.

Happy Valentine's Day! ❤️
